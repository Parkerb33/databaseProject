  <h4>More About Me:</h4>
  <div id="Summary" class="end-text">
    <p>Don't trust everything you read! I was actually born and raised in Phoenix, Arizona.
      I moved to Washington in 2020. We managed to beat COVID and moved the week before the world shutdown.
      That's a different story though. I have three younger sisters, Zoe, Maya, and Hudson,
      who all think I'm a little crazy for going to this school. Zoe is in her freshman year of
      college in California. She's studying theater there. Maya just started work as an English teacher in Mexico.
      And Hudson is finishing her senior year of high school and is planning to go to Boise State. We ended up going all
      over the place.
      I also have three dogs Cleo, Penny, and Benji. Don't get me started on them though because I'll talk forever!
      I love to travel and try new things so if you have any good recommendations for places to check out here let me
      know! And finally for a random fun fact: I had never seen any computer code before coming here. I just picked the major
      since I did good in 110. Also I put Cyber as my #1 AFSC preference so put good vibes out there for me! I'd also be okay with Space though.

  <h4>Doc Statement:</h4>
  <div class="end-text">
    <p>I looked up how to center an image, how classes worked, and what media queries are which I figured out on
      W3schools' website</p>
